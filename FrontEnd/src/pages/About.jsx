        <h3> We are a group of students at General Assembly that put together our skills to develop this site as our project.We have broken our group into Team Front End (Ryan, Brynner) and Team Back End (Michelle, Tim). We will review and make use of the lessons we've learned about React and Mongo/Express, and then use past lessons as basic skeletons on which to build our project. Michelle is currently our GitHub Captain. For our "Theme Park-Themed" full-stack app, we plan to build a database of major amusement parks in the US, as well as the most popular rollercoasters these parks have to offer. The database will be searchable, and have a variety of interative sorting methods to see a few different "Top Ten" lists of the best rollercoasters out there.  </h3>
